      "Collaborated directly with SP Madrid's CEO and cross-functional team to pioneer an AI-driven multimedia presentation that breathed new life into historical imagery. By leveraging advanced prompt engineering and cutting-edge AI video generation tools, I transformed static photographs into dynamic, emotionally resonant narratives. The project showcased AI's transformative potential in digital storytelling and archival restoration, creating an immersive experience that connected past and present while demonstrating how AI can preserve cultural heritage and make it accessible for modern audiences.",

    challenge:
      "SP Madrid needed to create an engaging multimedia presentation from decades-old static photographs to showcase their company's rich heritage and evolution. Traditional animation methods would require months of production time, exceed budget constraints, and risk losing the authentic character of the original imagery. The challenge was to modernize historical content while preserving its emotional authenticity and historical accuracy.",
    approach:
      "I led the AI implementation strategy by developing a systematic prompt engineering framework tailored for historical imagery. After evaluating multiple AI video generation platforms, I created custom workflows that balanced automation with creative control. Working closely with stakeholders, I established quality control processes to ensure historical accuracy while experimenting with various animation styles to achieve natural, emotionally resonant movement. The process involved iterative refinement, A/B testing different approaches, and maintaining close collaboration with the leadership team throughout production.",

      "Read AI needed a complete website redesign that could effectively communicate complex AI meeting intelligence features to non-technical users while driving conversions. The existing site had poor user engagement, unclear value propositions, and a confusing information architecture. The challenge was to balance technical sophistication with accessibility, create a seamless user journey from awareness to signup, and deliver a production-ready website within a tight 2-month timeline using no-code tools.",
    approach:
      "I conducted comprehensive user research and competitive analysis to understand the target audience's pain points and expectations. Working closely with the product team, I designed high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, establishing a comprehensive design system with reusable components, color schemes, and typography guidelines. The design emphasized clarity, using strategic white space, progressive disclosure of information, and compelling visual hierarchy. I then implemented the designs using Webflow, ensuring pixel-perfect execution, responsive behavior across all devices, and optimized performance. Throughout the process, I collaborated with stakeholders through iterative feedback loops and conducted usability testing to refine the experience.",
