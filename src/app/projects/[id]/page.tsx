      "SP Madrid needed to create an engaging multimedia presentation from decades-old static photographs to showcase their company's rich heritage and evolution. Traditional animation methods would require months of production time, exceed budget constraints, and risk losing the authentic character of the original imagery. The challenge was to modernize historical content while preserving its emotional authenticity and historical accuracy.",
    approach:
      "I led the AI implementation strategy by developing a systematic prompt engineering framework tailored for historical imagery. After evaluating multiple AI video generation platforms, I created custom workflows that balanced automation with creative control. Working closely with stakeholders, I established quality control processes to ensure historical accuracy while experimenting with various animation styles to achieve natural, emotionally resonant movement. The process involved iterative refinement, A/B testing different approaches, and maintaining close collaboration with the leadership team throughout production.",
